1. Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations?
    - My social distance detector was relatively effective at detecting the most apparent violations; however, it did have issues detecting more than about 20-25 people at a time!
2. Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time?  How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?
    - I thing this approach would be relatively effective in solving problems in real time if it were more accurate in detecting a larger group of people from more severely angled perspectives. Once the detector reaches a particular distance away from the camera, the detector fails to work.
3. What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?
    - I think that improvements can definitely be made! If the detector could reach a distance of at least 500 feat from a 30-45 angle of camera viewing, that would be very effective in solidifying more accurate contact tracing in both public and private spaces.
