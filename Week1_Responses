1. In Laurence Maroney’s video, What is ML, he compares traditional programming with machine learning and argues that the main difference between the two is a reorientation of the rules, data and answers.  According to Maroney, what is the difference between traditional programming and machine learning?
    - A: The difference between machine learning and traditional programming is the process in which machine learning occurs. Machine learning is a method in which coders teach a computer system to effectively evaluate a new set of data when given past “training” values and answers. It’s a way to teach the computer how to write the rules of an equation.

2. With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31.  Modify the predict function to produce the output for the value 7.  Do this twice and provide both answers.  Are they the same?  Are they different?  Why is this so?
    - First answer: [[22.002504]]
    - Second answer: [[21.997894]]
    - They are very similar (but different) values. The reason for this is because our machine is working off of a guessing value with a nearly perfect accuracy percentage. Because of this, the guesstimates will be slightly off by a factor of ~1%

3. Using the script you produced to predict housing price, take the provided six houses and train a neural net model that estimates the relationship between them. 
    1. Based on this model, which of the six homes present a good deal?  
        1. The Hudgins house presents the best deal because it shows the greatest difference in price between the models estimated value for a 3 bedroom house (which was calculated to be ~$211,785)
    2. Which one is the worst deal?  Justify your answer.
        1. Based off of house price and bedroom number, I would conclude that the Church house has the worst deal with an actual price of $399,000 vs. a $291,737 guessed price
